# Linux rice
Repo to strore all of my Linux rice

## Set up
This set up will use symlink so you can make the config constantly up-to-date. **Caution: this means I may push some config that isn't available in another system**

After initialize the set up, do this:
```bash
cd ~; mkdir .config; cd .config
git clone https://github.com/LukeNK/Linux-rice
cd Linux-rice
```

After that, continue with the guide for each system.
